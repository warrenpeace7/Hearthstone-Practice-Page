    <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro">My name is Tyler. I begin playing Hearthstone right after the release of Blackrock Mountain in mid 2015. It has been
        a truely delightful experience. Collectible card games have always been one of my favorite types of games. I remember
        as I child I was trying to "Catch them all". Though at the time my parents were not to eager to satisfy my desire
        for Pokemon cards. During my late teens I spent a lot of time (and money) playing MTG. Everytime I got a new pack
        of cards to open it was truely a feeling of ecstasy. When I found Hearthstone in 2015 I was truely hooked. Within
        months I had spent hundreds of dollars on the game to complete my collection. My collection quickly surpassing those
        of my friends. Every expansion I would look forward to as (Excluding Mean Streets of Gadgetzan). I got burnt out
        and have been taking a break for the last few months to focus on playing and researching board games. After playing
        a few dungeon runs I decided I wanted to be able to play once again. Hearthstone is truely one of my favorite games
        of all time.

            <br>
            <br> When Kazakus burst on the scene was something compeletly new. The tri-class cards were something different,
            out of the tri-class legendaries Kazakus was definately my favorite. I enjoyed how you could create your own
            potion. You had the option on how much mana you wanted to spend on the spell. If you were in a bind you could
            cheap out. Or if you were playing for the long run you could craft a 10 mana spell. The 10 mana spells were pretty
            awesome. Everytime it seemed like you got something a little different. My favorite deck to play Kazakus in was
            my Reno Mage. I loved the flexibily that I got playing Kazakus.

            <br> “We’re gonna be rich!” – Reno Jackson<br><br>
            Reno was the biggest card to come out of the LoE expansion in my opinion. I loved Reno in that it turned the meta from being very aggressive to having much more of a controlled slugfest. 
            It was all about getting the maximum value out of your cards when you could heal for 29 on one turn. Also, Justicar was released the same expansion which allowed warriors to armor up all day long. 
            Reno also brought in some cards you wouldn’t normally see played as much by forcing you to create a deck of 30 different cards. This brought more flexibility in deck building and forced a large change in a stale meta.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br> Alexstrasza is one of my favorite legendary dragons. 
            Alexstrasza was always an auto include in my freeze mage or really any control deck. 
            She allowed you to cut your opponents health down to 15 or she brought heals if you were in desperate need. Not only destroying your opponent’s health or healing but she also puts and 8/8 body on the field for 9 mana. 
            Talk about a great value. The golden art is also incredibly beautiful.

            <br>
            <br> Similar to Reno, Yogg as he came to be known completely changed the meta. 
            I’m not entirely sure if that was for better or for worse. 
            Yogg’s battlecry cast a random spell for every spell that you cast that game. 
            Oh, and I should mention that targets were chosen randomly. 
            For a long time even if Yogg died the spells would keep going and going. Sometimes it could be beneficial, and but I fell most of the time for me it ended up going the other way. 
            It was still some of the most fun that I ever had playing a spell-based Hunter deck.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br> The Lich King was always one of the figures I was the most drawn too. 
            I love the art of the Lich King and his famous sword Frostmourne. 
            For the art alone is reason enough to put him in my top 10. 
            Nevermind the fact that his is an incredible card. Much like Ysera, The Lich King puts a random (beneficial) card in your hand at the end of your turn. 
            One of those cards could be Frostmourne. As for his stats he is an 8/8 for 8 mana that has taunt. When played the ice that covers the board is awesome!
