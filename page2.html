        <br> “I AM POWER INCARNATE!!” DEATHWING how could I not choose Deathwing. 
        I mean he destroys everything on the board and makes you discard your hand. 
        He is the quintessential all or nothing Hearthstone card. I don’t often play him in constructed, I did have some fun with him in a Ramp druid deck and also a control-based Paladin deck however. 
        But if I see him pop up in arena however he is usually the one I grab. Because he is “POWER INCARNATE”.

        <br> “LEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JENKIIIIIIIIIIINS!” followed by “Time’s up! Let’s do this. 
        Those were some of the most heard words in my early hearthstone career. 
        When I first started to play Hearthstone, I played a lot of face Hunter…. I know, I know, quiet down. 
        This was partly due to the fact that I could win quickly and climb the ladder in the higher tiers fairly easily. 
        It was mostly due however to the fact that I only one golden legendary card at that time. 
        That was none other than the notorious LEEROY JENKINS. Leeroy Jenkins is not the best or most versatile legendary. 
        But he may be the most fun.

        <br> When Kazakus burst on the scene was something compeletly new. The tri-class cards were something different,
        out of the tri-class legendaries Kazakus was definately my favorite. I enjoyed how you could create your own
        potion. You had the option on how much mana you wanted to spend on the spell. If you were in a bind you could
        cheap out. Or if you were playing for the long run you could craft a 10 mana spell. The 10 mana spells were pretty
        awesome. Everytime it seemed like you got something a little different. My favority deck to play Kazakus in was
        my Reno Mage. I loved the flexibily that I got playing Kazakus.
