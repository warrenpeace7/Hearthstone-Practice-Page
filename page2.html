        <br> “I AM POWER INCARNATE!!” DEATHWING how could I not choose Deathwing. 
        I mean he destroys everything on the board and makes you discard your hand. 
        He is the quintessential all or nothing Hearthstone card. I don’t often play him in constructed, I did have some fun with him in a Ramp druid deck and also a control-based Paladin deck however. 
        But if I see him pop up in arena however he is usually the one I grab. Because he is “POWER INCARNATE”.

        <br> “LEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JENKIIIIIIIIIIINS!” followed by “Time’s up! Let’s do this. 
        Those were some of the most heard words in my early hearthstone career. 
        When I first started to play Hearthstone, I played a lot of face Hunter…. I know, I know, quiet down. 
        This was partly due to the fact that I could win quickly and climb the ladder in the higher tiers fairly easily. 
        It was mostly due however to the fact that I only one golden legendary card at that time. 
        That was none other than the notorious LEEROY JENKINS. Leeroy Jenkins is not the best or most versatile legendary. 
        But he may be the most fun.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Ragnaros the Firelord is an all-around great Hearthstone. 
        I love that he yells “Die Insect” when he attacks, and because he attacks typically at the end of your turn it’s like everyone has to stop and watch him. 
        Part of the fun of Ragnaros is that you don’t know who he will attack as he does 8 damage randomly. Sometimes you are cheering for him to hit face, and others you curse him for doing so. 
        That’s what makes Ragnaros so great. He also puts a lot of pressure on your opponent to remove him. (Unless they have a board full of 1/1 imps or something). 
        Ragnaros is great even that if he is silenced you still have an 8/8 minion on the board who can attack normally. For all the reasons above Ragnaros is my #3.

        <br>
        <br> Dr. 7 as he was called by many was released with Hearthstones first expansion Goblins vs. Gnomes. 
        He was incredibly powerful and was pretty much an auto include in any tempo deck due to the power of his boom bots. 
        You got 9/9 in minion value on the board along with the possibility of the boom bots randomly dealing 1-4 damage. 
        Many people were quickly calling for a nerf that never came. 
        Though he is a great card he is not seeing as much play in the wild format as you might expect. 
        Wild decks are crafted to very control based or very aggressive. It is hard for the doctor to find his place in the lineup.

        <br>
        <br> “Put your faith in the light!” Announces Tirion Fordring as he enters the arena. 
        Tirion as of today is my favorite Hearthstone card. 
        Tirion is a Paladin class card which means that you cannot put him in every deck like most of the others. 
        With that being said Paladin is my most played class. That is due to the fact that the mysterious challenger is my boy. 
        Paladin is just always a good time to play. They don’t seem overpowered typically but you always feel like you have a good shot to win. 
        Tirion himself is a 6/6 body with taunt and divine shield. He as a deathrattle that give you Ashbringer a 5/3 weapon. Tirion is the top dog in my book.
